      "119s - 122s:\n",

      " Quantum mechanics is really a framework\n",

      "\n",
      "139s - 143s:\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      " You have quantum chromodynamics, which\n",

      "\n",
      "191s - 194s:\n",
      " You have quantum gravity when you\n",

      " And why are you laughing?\n",
      "\n",
      "202s - 207s:\n",
      " And that's what gives rise to string theory, which\n",
      "\n",
      "207s - 210s:\n",
      " is presumably a quantum theory of gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "210s - 213s:\n",
      " And in fact, the quantum theory of all interactions,\n",
      "\n",
      "213s - 217s:\n",

      " but it describes all other forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "220s - 225s:\n",
      " So quantum mechanics is the framework,\n",
      "\n",
      "225s - 226s:\n",
      " and we apply it to many things.\n",
      "\n",
      "226s - 230s:\n",
      " So what are we going to cover today?\n",
      "\n",

      " What are we going to review?\n",
      "\n",
      "231s - 234s:\n",
      " Essentially, five topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "234s - 243s:\n",
      " One, the linearity of quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "243s - 250s:\n",
      " Two, the necessity of complex numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "254s - 259s:\n",
      " Three, the laws of determinism.\n",
      "\n",
      "259s - 270s:\n",
      " Four, the unusual features of superposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "282s - 286s:\n",
      " And finally, what is entanglement?\n",
      "\n",
      "289s - 298s:\n",
      " So that's what we aim to discuss today.\n",
      "\n",
      "298s - 305s:\n",
      " So we will begin with the number one, linearity.\n",
      "\n",
      "305s - 310s:\n",
      " And that's a very fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics,\n",
      "\n",
      "310s - 314s:\n",
      " something that we have to pay a lot of attention to.\n",
      "\n",
      "314s - 317s:\n",
      " So whenever you have a theory, you\n",
      "\n",
      "317s - 320s:\n",
      " have some dynamical variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "320s - 323s:\n",
      " These are the variables you want to find their values,\n",
      "\n",
      "323s - 326s:\n",
      " because they are connected with observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "326s - 330s:\n",
      " If you have dynamical variables, you\n",
      "\n",
      "330s - 333s:\n",
      " can compare the values of those variables,\n",
      "\n",
      "333s - 336s:\n",
      " or some values deduced from those variables,\n",
      "\n",
      "336s - 339s:\n",
      " to the results of an experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "339s - 341s:\n",
      " So you have equations of motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "341s - 343s:\n",
      " So linearity.\n",
      "\n",
      "343s - 345s:\n",
      " We're talking linearity.\n",
      "\n",
      "348s - 353s:\n",
      " You have some equations of motion, EOM.\n",
      "\n",
      "353s - 361s:\n",
      " And you have dynamical variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "361s - 364s:\n",
      " If you have a theory, you have some equations\n",
      "\n",
      "364s - 368s:\n",
      " that you have solved for those dynamical variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "368s - 375s:\n",
      " And the most famous example of a theory that is linear\n",
      "\n",
      "375s - 379s:\n",
      " is Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.\n",
      "\n",

      " Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism\n",
      "\n",
      "380s - 382s:\n",
      " is a linear theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "382s - 384s:\n",
      " What does that mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "384s - 387s:\n",
      " Well, first, practically, what it means\n",
      "\n",
      "387s - 391s:\n",
      " is that if you have a solution, for example, a plane wave\n",
      "\n",
      "391s - 396s:\n",
      " propagating in this direction, and you\n",
      "\n",
      "396s - 403s:\n",
      " have another solution, a plane wave propagating towards you,\n",
      "\n",
      "403s - 406s:\n",
      " then you can form a third solution,\n",
      "\n",
      "406s - 413s:\n",
      " which is two plane waves propagating simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "413s - 415s:\n",
      " And you don't have to change anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "415s - 420s:\n",
      " You can just put them together, and you get the new solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "420s - 424s:\n",
      " The two waves propagate without touching each other,\n",
      "\n",
      "424s - 427s:\n",
      " without affecting each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "427s - 431s:\n",
      " And together, they form a new solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "431s - 434s:\n",
      " This is extraordinarily useful in practice,\n",
      "\n",
      "434s - 437s:\n",

      " verify that it solves Maxwell's equation.\n",

      " You multiply this by alpha, alpha e, alpha b, alpha rho,\n",

      " But L must have important properties,\n",
      "\n",
      "800s - 806s:\n",

      " where A is a number, should be equal to ALU.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "822s - 826s:\n",

      " This is what we mean by the operator being linear.\n",
      "\n",
      "831s - 835s:\n",
      " So if an operator is linear, you also\n",
      "\n",

      " have L on alpha U1 plus beta U2.\n",
      "\n",
      "842s - 846s:\n",
      " You apply first the second property, L on the first\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      " this is alpha L of U1 plus beta L of U2.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "874s - 887s:\n",
      " U1 and U2 are solutions, which means L U1 equal L U2 equal 0,\n",

      " if they solve the equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "890s - 903s:\n",
      " Then alpha U1 plus beta U2 is a solution,\n",
      "\n",
      "903s - 910s:\n",
      " because if L U1 is 0 and L U2 is 0, L of alpha U1 plus beta U2\n",

      " is 0, and it is a solution.\n",
      "\n",

      " So this is how we write a linear equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "924s - 928s:\n",
      " Now, an example probably would help\n",
      "\n",
      "928s - 934s:\n",
      " if I have the differential equation dU dt plus 1\n",
      "\n",

      " over tau U equals 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "939s - 946s:\n",
      " I can write it as an equation of the form L U equals 0\n",
      "\n",
      "946s - 960s:\n",
      " by taking L on U to be defined to be dU dt plus 1 over tau U.\n",
      "\n",
      "960s - 964s:\n",

      "\n",
      "964s - 968s:\n",

      "\n",
      "968s - 969s:\n",
      " to be this.\n",
      "\n",
      "969s - 973s:\n",
      " And then certainly this equation is just L U equals 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "973s - 977s:\n",
      " The question would be maybe if somebody would tell you,\n",
      "\n",
      "977s - 981s:\n",
      " how do you write L alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "981s - 984s:\n",
      " Well, L alone, probably we should write it\n",
      "\n",
      "984s - 993s:\n",
      " as d dt without anything here plus 1 over tau.\n",
      "\n",
      "993s - 995s:\n",
      " Now, that's a way you would write\n",
      "\n",
      "995s - 998s:\n",
      " it to try to understand yourself what's going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "998s - 1002s:\n",
      " And you say, well, then when L acts on the variable U,\n",
      "\n",
      "1002s - 1004s:\n",
      " the first term takes the derivative.\n",
      "\n",
      "1004s - 1009s:\n",
      " And the second term, which is a number, just multiplies it.\n",
      "\n",
      "1009s - 1012s:\n",
      " So you could write L as this thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "1012s - 1020s:\n",
      " And now it is straightforward to check\n",
      "\n",
      "1020s - 1023s:\n",
      " that this is a linear operator.\n",
      "\n",

      " L is linear.\n",
      "\n",

      " And for that, you have to check the two properties there.\n",
      "\n",
      "1032s - 1041s:\n",
      " So for example, L on Au would be d dt of Au plus 1\n",
      "\n",
      "1041s - 1051s:\n",
      " over tau Au, which is A times dU d tau plus 1 over tau U,\n",
